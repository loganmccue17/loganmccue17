## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a Homepage for my GitHub Projects!

Click on the repositories to look into any specific project! On some of these projects, I will have an html link on the right-side that will bring to an organized jupyterbook that makes the repository more readable.

Here is a Table of Contents for my Projects:

- intro_to_ds : Includes Introductory Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
- SO2_Sat_Eval : Includes a Satellite Emissions Project Done with the Joint Global Change Research Institute of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
- dungeon_delvers : Includes a Work-In-Progress Dungeon and Dragons inspired Rogue-like Game
